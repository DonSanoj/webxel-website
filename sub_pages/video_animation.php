                    Discover:

                    Creating a logo demands more than just an artistic touch. It requires a strategic approach that transcends mere aesthetic preferences. A logo acts as the focal point of all brand communication, permeating every aspect of its identity. It must be built to endure, avoiding the need for frequent redesigns. Therefore, thorough research is vital to ensure the development of a logo that can withstand the test of time.<br>

                    <br>Sketch:

                    Determining whether a symbol or a distinctive typographic treatment of the brand name is necessary forms a crucial step. We recognize the significance of a symbol that can serve as a compact visual representation, especially when the full name might be illegible at smaller sizes. While the process of sketching logos can be time-consuming, taking breaks and allowing ideas to germinate and evolve in the mind is imperative for a refined outcome. <br>

                    <br>Design:

                    At WEBXEL, we pride ourselves on being a team of adept logo designers in Sri Lanka, boasting a wealth of experience in the art of crafting remarkable logos by hand.
